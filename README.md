# qoiJS embed

A chrome extension that adds 'support' for the qoi format by using [kchapelier/qoijs](https://github.com/kchapelier/qoijs)

## Important Notes:

	- This extension just replaces any image urls pointing towards qoi images with converted data urls
	- After 10 seconds have passed, it slows down and runs once every 10 seconds instead of 2 to improve performance
	- This extension is pointless as no sane person will ever try to use images on their page that aren't in a format supported by any browsers
